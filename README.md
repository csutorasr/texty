# texty
Fully customizable WYSIWYG html editor with custom tags.
The library does not use the browsers build-in functions to edit the html code, so everything can be customized. If you are in favor of HTML5 `STRONG` element you do not have to use build-in `B` element of the browser.

JQuery adapter is coming soon.
It is going to available on npm soon.
